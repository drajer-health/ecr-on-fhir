The main linearization of ICD-11 is Mortality and Morbidity Statistics (MMS). Various linearizations could be built at different granularity, use case or other purposes such as for Primary Care, Clinical Care or Research. The linkage from the foundation component to a particular linearization will ensure consistent use of the ICD.\"\r\n\r\nICD-11 for Mortality and Morbidity (ICD-11 MMS) can be downloaded in either print or electronic (spreadsheet) format from the  browser in the Info tab located [here](https://icd.who.int/browse11/l-m/en)","copyright":"The WHO grants a license for \"commercial and non-commercial use\" of ICD-11\r\n\r\nCC BY-ND 3.0 IGO\r\n\r\nDetailed information can be found here: [https://icd.who.int/en/docs/icd11-license.pdf](https://icd.who.int/en/docs/icd11-license.pdf)\r\n\r\nContact licensing@who.int to obtain further information.","caseSensitive":true,"content":"not-present"}
